Project Overview


This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in individuals based on various medical parameters. By employing different machine learning algorithms, the project seeks to provide accurate diagnostics that could assist healthcare providers in the early detection of heart diseases.

Project Description


The primary objective of this project is to classify patients into two categories: 
0 for no heart disease and 1 for heart disease present. The classification is based on a range of features including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic (ECG) results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia.

Dataset


The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes various features: age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia. These features are utilized to predict the target variable, which indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.
